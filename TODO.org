* TODO Sync dependencies

Right now sync ignores when just dependencies are altered on a
deployed Change. It isn't necessary to re-deploy since it obviously
got deployed.

Changed dependencies should be updated in the deployed plan, in the
event that they are correcting a dependency problem that might
otherwise prevent revert.

In the event that DDL has also changed, the new dependencies may
reflect that change, may correct earlier dependency issues, or may do
both:

- Since the first case is most likely, we should probably do the
  revert based on the original dependencies
- We could try that and failing it try changing the dependencies first
  instead
- We may also need in a worst case where dependency corrections and
  new dependencies are combined to try the revert with all
  dependencies combined
- Even then, we may fail if the combined dependencies introduce
  problems such as circularity?

* TODO Better error reporting

** TODO Probably want a top level UserError exception

To consistently carry error details in a way that can be nicely
formatted

** TODO Nicely display errors

** TODO Provide better diagnostics on bad graphs

The topological_sort function can only tell if it runs out of sortable
elements; it cannot report if the reason is circular dependencies or a
bad dependency.

Another option here is to validate all dependencies before sorting, so
there is only one possible error when sorting.

* TODO Figure out a way to preserve json source

Would be nice to be able to modify a plan and write back the plan.json
with just the changed bits modified, leaving original whitespace
formatting. Consider hjson...

https://hjson.org/

Another option: give up json and use more strictly defined format(s).
